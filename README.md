## Features

- Create notes in Trilium
- Specify the parent of the note

## Prerequisites

Before you start using this extension, ensure you have Raycast and Trilium installed on your system.

## Configuration

You'll need an API key from Trilium. You can generate one by going to `Options > ETAPI` and clicking `Create new ETAPI key`. The configuration assumes you have Trilium installed on the same machine as Raycast. If you don't, you'll need to update the `triliumServerUrl` variable in the configuration.

## Usage

You can create a note by typing `Create note` and then entering the title and content of the note. You can also select the parent of the note, it defaults to the root of your Trilium instance.
